**[Working Memory Model (Baddeley and Hitch)](https://www.simplypsychology.org/working-memory.html)**

Working memory encompasses your active understanding and contextualization of immediate information requiring dynamic processing. For a chatbot, this represents the maintenance and manipulation of conversational context observed throughout real-time interactions.

The type of information maintained in working memory consists of active messages and roles, current task/goal parameters, immediate state representations, and contextual processing requirements. This includes message history with associated metadata, conversation state vectors, goal hierarchies, and temporary computational results requiring immediate access.
